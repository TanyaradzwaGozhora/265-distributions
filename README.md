# DistributionPackage
A pip package which will hopefully have all the distributions from STATS265(Stats 1) - Ualberta soon


Currently:
* Bernoulli
* Binomial
* Gaussian (Normal)


Strongly recommend running it on a virtual environment!

Testing was done using unittest library https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

Installation:
    pip install gozhora-distributions
